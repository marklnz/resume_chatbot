## Experience

#### Tobii Dynavox

#### Lead Software Engineer

July 2022 - Present (2 years 10 months)

#### Eyede Solutions

#### Development Lead/Software Architect

January 2013 - August 2022 (9 years 8 months)
Lower Hutt, New Zealand and Remote

Team lead, architect and software engineer.

I'm a full stack software developer and architect responsible for leading in-
house software development team at Eyede, working predominantly with
Microsoft technologies on complex web based applications.

Currently working as architect and principal developer on a next generation
web application using Microsoft's Blazor Web Assembly application framework,
running on .Net 6. This project is a replacement for a legacy Asp.Net MVC
monolith application. The architecture I'm implementing for this project is
based on a microservices back end, with the Blazor WASM application
framework being used to build a SPA web client. I have designed and
implemented the UI using Github's Primer CSS framework, and the back end
services leverage CQRS and Event Sourcing patterns, and are hosted on
Azure, using Azure Kubernetes Service and Azure App Services.

One element of this project that is already in production is a "trip processing"
component, which has resulted in throughput increases of 600% compared to
the legacy product.

I oversaw and collaborated with the other senior developers in building a next
generation multi tier web application architecture using Angular, TypeScript,
JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS 3, backed with WebAPI components using
ASP.Net Core, Entity Framework Core and SQL Server.

I configured and managed Eyede's internal TFS server deployment. I also
developed the team's DevOps processes and procedures, using TFS, Team
Build and Octopus Deploy.

I migrated Eyede's internal TFS based DevOps tooling to Visual Studio Online
(now Azure DevOps), with Git for version control, and leveraging Azure
DevOps pipelines for build and deployment.
